# T-Rex Runner

T-Rex runner is an infamous Running game with a dinosuar as the main character. It was originally made for Google's new browser as an easter egg for people to find. You may know it as "Chrome Dino".

# Upgraded?!?

What I did is get the T-Rex Runner Source code from wayou and compile it for the Original game as well as some different character. Instead of it just being a dinosuar, it could be covid jumping over people, to sonic the hedgehog jumping over the cacti instead!

# How to play?

Visit the official T-Rex Runner v2 [website](https://p-dennygamingyt.github.io/T-Rex-Runner-v2) and select your character. Currently there is only one (the original dino) however I will add some new ones in the very near future. Probably by the end of this week.
